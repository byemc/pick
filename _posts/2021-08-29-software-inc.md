(This review is still being written - yes I know this is stupid)

As a person who programs shit for a hobby, a game about actually *developing* software seems like good fun. And, believe it or not, it is!

[Software Inc.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362620/Software_Inc/) is a sandbox game that's going to ~~take all our jobs and replace them with sitting down and playing a computer game~~ have you immersed for hours working out <span title="Yes, you can actually do this">how to snoop on people without getting sued.</span>

I've played a good bit of this game through Alpha 10; however, Alpha 11 is, as of now, the default, so if you want to try Alpha 10, you'll have to go into Steam's beta settings.
